If your army is Battle-forged and includes any ORKS Detachments (excluding Auxiliary Support, or Fortification Network, then when you muster your army, you can upgrade any ORKS model in your army with one Kustom Job. Each Kustom Job below will list the units that it can be applied to and its effect. Each time you give a unit a Kustom Job, its Power Rating is increased, as shown in the table at the start of that section. Vehicle Kustom Jobs can only be given to a unit that contains one model.  
  
If you are playing a matched play game, or a game that uses a points limit, then the points value of that model is also increased by the amount shown in the same table. If a Kustom Job shows more than one value, the second value is used if the unit being given the Kustom Job has a Power Rating of 10 or more. Make a note on your army roster each time you upgrade a model using these rules.  
  
A SPECIALIST MOB cannot be selected to have any Kustom Jobs, and each Kustom Job can only be selected once in your army. Each model can only have 1 Kustom Job. Named characters can never have any Kustom Jobs.  
  
A Crusade force cannot start with any Kustom Jobs - to include any in a Crusade force, you must spend Scrap points. If a unit from a Crusade force is given any Kustom Jobs, it cannot be selected for the Fresh RecruitsRequisition. If a Kustom Job, such as Da Booma, replaces a weapon, you cannot remove or replace that weapon using the Rearm and Resupply Requisition.  
  
If a model in your Crusade force gains any Kustom Jobs during a battle as a result of the Iâ€™ve Got Just da Fing ability of a Mekboy Workshop, they are lost at the end of the battle.
