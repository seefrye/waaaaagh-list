>Use this Stratagem at the start of the [Fight phase](https://wahapedia.ru/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#FIGHT-PHASE). Select one GOFF COREor GOFF CHARACTER unit from your army that has the No Mukkinâ€™ About Clan Kultur. Until the end of the phase, each time a model in that unit makes an attack, it scores an additional hit on an unmodified hit roll of 5+ instead of 6.
