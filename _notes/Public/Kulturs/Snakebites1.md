# Da Old Ways
## Description

-   Each time an attack is made against a unit with this kultur, unless that attack has a Strength characteristic of 8 or more, an unmodified wound roll of 1-3 for that attack fails, irrespective of any abilities that the weapon or the model making the attack may have.
-   Each time a SQUIG model with this kultur makes a melee attack, if that model’s unit made a charge move or performed a HeroicIntervention this turn, add 1 to that attack’s wound roll.
