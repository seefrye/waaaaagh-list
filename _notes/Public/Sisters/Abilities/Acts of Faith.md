# Acts of Faith

---

## Description

Once per phase, one unit from your army with this ability can perform one Act of Faith. To do so, you will use Miracle dice.  
  
Gaining Miracle Dice  
If every unit from your army has the ADEPTA SORORITAS keyword (excluding models with the CULT IMPERIALIS, AGENT OF THE IMPERIUM or UNALIGNEDkeywords), then:  

-   At the start of each battle round, you gain 1 Miracle dice.
-   At the end of a phase in which any of the following conditions were met, you gain 1 Miracle dice:

  

Vengeance

Any ADEPTA SORORITAS units from your army destroy one or more enemy units.  
  

Sacrifice

Any ADEPTA SORORITAS CHARACTER units from your army are destroyed.  
  
Note that Miracle dice can also be gained via other rules. No matter the source, you can only gain Miracle dice from such a rule if every unit from your army has the ADEPTA SORORITAS keyword (excluding models with the CULT IMPERIALIS, AGENT OF THE IMPERIUM or UNALIGNED keywords).  
  
Each time you gain a Miracle dice, roll one D6. The number you roll is the value of that Miracle dice. This value cannot be changed or re-rolled, unless a rule specifically states otherwise. Keep your Miracle dice to one side - this is your Miracle dice pool.  
  
**Designerâ€™s Note:** _We recommend using differently coloured or marked dice for your Miracle dice pool, and placing them to one side of the battle.field, or some place else where you will not accidentally pick them up midgame. It is perfectly fine, if you wish, to write down the values of the Miracle dice in your pool, or to keep track of them in any other way, just so long as both players can see them._  
  
Performing an Act of Faith  
Before making a dice roll for a model or a unit from your army with the Acts of Faith ability, if you have one or more dice in your Miracle dice pool, that unit can perform an Act of Faith. To do so, select one or more of the dice from your Miracle dice pool, instead of making any or all of those dice rolls. For each individual dice that is being rolled as part of the dice roll, you can select 1 Miracle dice from your Miracle dice pool to be substituted in place of that dice. The dice that it is being substituted for is not rolled, and instead the value of the selected Miracle dice is used as if it had been rolled. Each Miracle dice can only be selected for substitution once. Once all Miracle dice substitutions have been made, remove the chosen Miracle dice from your Miracle dice pool, and roll any remaining, unsubstituted dice that are a part of the dice roll. You can use Miracle dice when a unit performs an Act of Faith for any of the following types of dice roll:  

-   Advance roll
-   Charge roll
-   Hit roll
-   Wound roll
-   Saving throw
-   Damage roll
-   Morale test

A Miracle dice is not a modifier or an inherently modified dice (so, for example, if you use a Miracle dice with a value of 1 for a Morale test, that is considered to be an unmodified roll of 1). A Miracle dice that has been used for a substitution can never be re-rolled. This means that if any re-rolls occur, the number and values of any Miracle dice that have already been substituted in the dice roll remain the same for the re-roll (for example, if a single Miracle dice was used to substitute one of the values of a charge roll, and the charge roll was re-rolled, only the unsubstituted dice can be re-rolled).
