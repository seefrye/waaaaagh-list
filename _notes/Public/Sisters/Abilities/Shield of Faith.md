# Shield of Faith

---

## Description

Models in this unit have a 6+ invulnerable save. In your opponentâ€™s Psychic phase, this unit can attempt to deny one psychic power as if it were a PSYKER. Each time a Deny the Witch test is taken for this unit, roll one D6 instead of 2D6: if the result of that test was an unmodified result of 6, or if it was greater than the result of the Psychic test, that Deny the Witch test is passed.
