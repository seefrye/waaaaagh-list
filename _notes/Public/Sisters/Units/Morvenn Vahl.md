## Abilities
- **[[Acts of Faith]]**
- **[[Sacred Rites]]**
- **[[Shield of Faith]]:** Models in this unit have a 6+ invulnerable save. In your opponent’s Psychic phase, this unit can attempt to deny one psychic power as if it were a PSYKER. Each time a Deny the Witch test is taken for this unit, roll one D6 instead of 2D6: if the result of that test was an unmodified result of 6, or if it was greater than the result of the Psychic test, that Deny the Witch test is passed.
- **[[Purgator Mirabilis Warsuit]]:** This model has a 4+ invulnerable save. Each time this model would lose a wound as the result of a mortal wound, roll one D6: on a 4+, that wound is not lost.
- **[[Holy Aegis]]:** Each time an attack is allocated to this model, halve the Damage characteristic of that attack (rounding up).
- **[[Righteous Repugnance]]:** Once per battle, at the end of the Fight phase, if this model is within Engagement Range of any enemy units, it can fight again.
- **[[High Lord of the Imperium]]:** If your army is Battle-forged, this model must be your army’s WARLORD. If more than one model in your army has a rule to this effect, then one of those models must be your army’s WARLORD.
- **[[Abbess Sanctorum]] (AURA):** While a friendly ADEPTA SORORITAS CORE unit is within 6" of this model, each time a model in that unit makes an attack, re-roll a hit roll of 1 and re-roll a wound roll of 1.
- **[[Commander of the Adepta Sororitas]]:** In your Command phase, select one friendly ADEPTA SORORITAS CORE or ADEPTA SORORITAS CHARACTER unit within 6" of this model. Until the start of your next Command phase, each time a model in that unit makes an attack, you can re-roll the hit roll and you can re-roll the wound roll.
- **[[Explodes]]:** When this model is destroyed, roll one D6 before removing it from play. On a 6 it explodes, and each unit within 6" suffers 1 mortal wound.
