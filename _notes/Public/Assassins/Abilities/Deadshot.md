## Description

Each time you select a target for a weapon this model is making an attack with, you can ignore the Look Out, Sir rule. In addition, on an unmodified wound roll of 6 for an attack made with an exitus pistol or exitus rifle, change the Damage characteristic of that weapon to D6 for that attack
