## Description

If, after resolving an attack with an exitus pistol or exitus rifle by this model, a model in an enemy unit lost any wounds as a result of that attack but was not destroyed, roll one D6; on a 3+ that model suffers 1 mortal wound and, if that model is not destroyed, you can roll one more D6. This time, that model suffers 1 mortal wound on a 4+. Keep rolling one D6, increasing the result required to cause a mortal wound by 1 each time, until the model in the enemy unit being rolled for is destroyed or the roll is failed.
