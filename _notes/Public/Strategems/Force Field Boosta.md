Use this Stratagem at the start of your opponent’s Shooting phase. Select one model in your army that is equipped with a kustom force field. Until the end of the turn, replace that kustom force field’s ability with the following:  
> - (Aura) While a friendly ORKS unit is within 9" of the bearer, models in that unit have a 5+ invulnerable save.’  
> - At the end of this turn, the kustom force field overloads and cannot be used for the rest of the battle. You can only use this Stratagem once per battle.
