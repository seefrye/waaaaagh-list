## 2 CP
### Description

Use this Stratagem at the start of the Fight phase. Select one GOFF COREor GOFF CHARACTER unit from your army that has the No Mukkin’ About Clan Kultur. Until the end of the phase, each time a model in that unit makes an attack, it scores an additional hit on an unmodified hit roll of 5+ instead of 6.
