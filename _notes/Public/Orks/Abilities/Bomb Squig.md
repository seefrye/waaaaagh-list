# Bomb Squig

---

# Description

Once per turn, when a unit with a bomb squig is selected to shoot or fire Overwatch, if it has any bomb squigs remaining, the unit can release one. When it does so, you can select one enemy unit (excluding AIRCRAFT) that is within 12" of the unit with a bomb squig (when firing Overwatch, this must be the charging unit) and roll one D6, adding 1 to the result if that enemy unit is a VEHICLE; on a 3+, that enemy unit suffers D3 mortal wounds. The number of bomb squigs the unit is equipped with is then reduced by 1.
