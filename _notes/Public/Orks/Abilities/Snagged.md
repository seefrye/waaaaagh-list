# Description

Each time this model makes an attack with its stikka kannon, if an enemy VEHICLE or MONSTER model (excluding TITANIC or AIRCRAFT models) loses any wounds as a result of that attack, roll one D6: on a 4+, that enemy model cannot finish any type of move more than 12" from this model until the start of your next turn. If this model moves for any reason, or is destroyed, this effect ends.
