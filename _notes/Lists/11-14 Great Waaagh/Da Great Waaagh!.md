# Gameplan
- Ghaz calls a great waaagh turn one, letting core anc characters advance and charge
- Trukk moves, trukkboyz and warboss hop out within 3", move, advance, and charge
    - Warboss' trait gives other units +1 to charge units he's engaged with, so charge with him first
- Bikers move 14" and advance 6", which should make it easy to get them into charge range
- Psykers are trying to deep strike units and buff them with more/better attacks
- _Everything_ gets +1 attacks while the waaagh is on
