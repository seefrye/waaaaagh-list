# Mozrog Skragbad, Warlord
## Mozrog Skragbad
### Abilities
- **[[Beastboss]]:** (Aura) +1 to melee hits [[While a friendly SNAKEBITE BEAST SNAGGA CORE or SNAKEBITE BEAST SNAGGA CHARACTER unit is within 6" of this model, each time a model in that unit makes a melee attack, add 1 to that attack’s hit roll.::srs]]
- **[[Beast Snagga]]** +1 to hit VEHICLE/MONSTERs [[Each time a model with this ability makes an attack that targets a VEHICLE or MONSTER, add 1 to that attack’s hit roll; Every model in this unit has a 6++ invulnerable save::srs]]
- **[[Ere We Go]]:** Re-roll charges [[You can re-roll charge rolls made for units with this ability.::srs]]
- **[[Thick Hide]]:** -1 damage [[Each time an attack is allocated this model, subtract 1 from the Damage characteristic of that attack (to a minimum of 1).::srs]]
- **[[Tougher than a Rok Squig]]:** 4++ invulnerable save
- **[[Waaagh\|Waaagh!]]
- **[[Surly as a Squiggoth]]:** First time he dies, on a 4+ he comes back with d3 wounds [[The first time this WARLORD is destroyed, you can choose to roll one D6 at the end of the phase instead of using any rules that are triggered when a model is destroyed (e.g. the Orks is Never Beaten Stratagem). If you do so, then on a 4+, set this WARLORD back up on the battlefield as close as possible to where they were destroyed and not within Engagement Range of any enemy models, with D3 wounds remaining.::srs]]
