- Only wounded on 4+ [[Each time an attack is made against a unit with this kultur, unless that attack has a Strength characteristic of 8 or more, an unmodified wound roll of 1-3 for that attack fails, irrespective of any abilities that the weapon or the model making the attack may have.::srs]]
- SQUIGs get +1 to wound if they charged [[Each time a SQUIG model with this kultur makes a melee attack, if that model’s unit made a charge move or performed a Heroic Intervention this turn, add 1 to that attack’s wound roll.::srs]]

# Strategy
- Keep SQUIGs within 6" of Kill Rig to get extra damage
- Keep BEATS SNAGGAs within 6" of Mozrog to get +1 to melee hits
- Pile mortal wounds on whatever's nastiest
    - Each squignob deals mortal wounds when charging
    - Headwoppa's Killchoppa deals additional mortal wounds on 6s
    - Bitin' Jaws good against multiple units
    - Burna bombs deal mortal wounds, aim for highest concentration of models - not units
    - Bomb squig deals some mortal wounds - one use only, but may be the only damage the squighog boyz do
    - Mozrog deals bonkers mortal wounds in combat, even more so if he gets buffed by the Kill Rig
- All the BEAST SNAGGAs get +1 to hit against MONSTERs, so the deathstar will want to crash from the biggest bug to the next biggest bug
    - We may want to consider going second, if given the choice. That would have us much more likely to successfully charge turn 1
