# Vindicare, Assassin
## Vindicare Assassin
### Abilities
- **[[Agent of the Imperium]]:** [[If your army is Battle-forged, you can include 1 AGENT OF THE IMPERIUM unit in each IMPERIUM (excluding FALLEN) Patrol, Battalion and Brigade Detachment in your army without those units taking up slots in those Detachments. The inclusion of an AGENT OF THE IMPERIUM unit does not prevent other units from their Detachment from benefiting from Detachment abilities (e.g. Chapter Tactics, Defenders of Humanity etc.), and it does not prevent other units from your army benefiting from abilities that require every model in your army to have that ability (e.g. Combat Doctrines). An AGENT OF THE IMPERIUM unit included in a Patrol, Battalion or Brigade Detachment in this manner is ignored for any rules that state all units from that Detachment must have at least one Faction keyword in common (e.g. in a matched play game) and when determining your Army Faction.::srs]]
- **[[Deadshot]]:** Ignore Look Out, Sir; 6s to wound deal d6 damage [[Each time you select a target for a weapon this model is making an attack with, you can ignore the Look Out, Sir rule. In addition, on an unmodified wound roll of 6 for an attack made with an exitus pistol or exitus rifle, change the Damage characteristic of that weapon to D6 for that attack.::srs]]
- **[[Execution Force]]:** [[If your Warlord has the IMPERIUM keyword (excluding FALLEN), you can include this unit in your army as part of a Vanguard Detachment even if that Detachment contains no HQ units. If you do so, that Detachment’s Command Benefits are changed to ‘None’ and its Restrictions are changed to ‘This Detachment cannot include the same datasheet more than once.'::srs]]
- **[[Faultless Aim]]:** Always hits on 2+ [[Attacks made with ranged weapons by this model always hit on a 2+ if this model did not move this turn (hit rolls of 6 are still required when firing Overwatch).::srs]]
- **[[Head Shot]]:** Deal mortal wounds if it doesn't get a kill [[If, after resolving an attack with an exitus pistol or exitus rifle by this model, a model in an enemy unit lost any wounds as a result of that attack but was not destroyed, roll one D6; on a 3+ that model suffers 1 mortal wound and, if that model is not destroyed, you can roll one more D6. This time, that model suffers 1 mortal wound on a 4+. Keep rolling one D6, increasing the result required to cause a mortal wound by 1 each time, until the model in the enemy unit being rolled for is destroyed or the roll is failed.::srs]]
- **[[Independent Operative]]:** Can deepstrike [[This model can never have a Warlord Trait. During deployment, you can set this model up in concealment instead of placing it on the battlefield. At the end of any of your Movement phases, this model can reveal its position – set it up anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9" away from any enemy models.::srs]]
- **[[Lightning Reflexes]]:** This model has a 4+ invulnerable save.
- **[[Spymask]]:** Denies cover [[When resolving an attack made with a ranged weapon by this model, the target does not receive the benefit of cover to its saving throw.::srs]]
- **[[Stealth Suit]]:** Give -1 to hit, -2 if in cover [[When resolving an attack made with a ranged weapon against this model, subtract 1 from the hit roll. If this model is on or in a terrain feature, subtract 2 from the hit roll instead.::srs]]
