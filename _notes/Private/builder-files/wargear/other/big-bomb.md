-**[[Big Bomb]]:** Once per battle, in your Movement phase, after the bearer makes a Normal Move or Advances, you can select one point on the battlefield the bearer moved across this phase. Roll one D6 for each unit within 3" of that point, subtracting 1 if that unit is a CHARACTER (excluding VEHICLE or MONSTER units); on a 4+, that unit suffers D3 mortal wounds.
