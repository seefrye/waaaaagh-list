-**[[Burna Bombs]]:** Once per turn, if the bearer has any burna bombs remaining, it can drop one of them. In your Movement phase, after the bearer makes a Normal Move or Advances, you can select one point on the battlefield the bearer moved across this phase. Roll one D6 for each model within 6" of that point, subtracting 1 if that model is a CHARACTER (excluding VEHICLE or MONSTER models): on a 5+, that modelâ€™s unit suffers 1 mortal wound. Each burna bomb can only be dropped once per battle.
