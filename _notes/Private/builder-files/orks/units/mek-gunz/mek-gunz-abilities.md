- **[[Artillery and Crew]]:** Cannot advance, charge, Heroically Intervene, pile-in or consolidate [[Each Mek Gun and its crew are treated as a single model for all rules purposes (crew models must remain within 1" of their Mek Gun model). This means that the crew models cannot be targeted or attacked separately and that visibility and all ranges are measured to and from the Mek Gunâ€™s model, not the crew models. This unit cannot Advance, is never eligible to charge or Heroically Intervene, and cannot make pile-in or consolidation moves.::srs]]
