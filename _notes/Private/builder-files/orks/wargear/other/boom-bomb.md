- **[[Boom Bomb]]:** Once per turn, if the bearer has any boom bombs remaining, it can drop one of them. In your Movement phase, after the bearer makes a Normal Move or Advances, you can select one point on the battlefield the bearer moved across this phase. Roll one D6 for each unit within 6" of that point, subtracting 1 if that unit is a CHARACTER (excluding VEHICLE or MONSTER units): on a 4+, that unit suffers D3 mortal wounds. On a 6, that unit suffers D6 mortal wounds instead. Each boom bomb can only be dropped once per battle.
