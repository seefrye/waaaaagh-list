- **[[Airborne]]:** Can't charge, can only be charged by FLYers [[You cannot declare a charge with this model, and it can only be chosen as a target of a charge if the unit making the charge can FLY. You can only fight with this model if it is within Engagement Range of any enemy units that can FLY, and this model can only make melee attacks against units that can FLY. Enemy units can only make melee attacks against this model if they can FLY.::srs]]
- **2x [[Burna Bombs]]:** Roll d6 for each model within 6" of a point you flew over. Unit takes one mortal wound per 5+, -1 for non-VEHICLE/MONSTER CHARACTERs [[Once per turn, if the bearer has any burna bombs remaining, it can drop one of them. In your Movement phase, after the bearer makes a Normal Move or Advances, you can select one point on the battlefield the bearer moved across this phase. Roll one D6 for each model within 6" of that point, subtracting 1 if that model is a CHARACTER (excluding VEHICLE or MONSTER models): on a 5+, that model’s unit suffers 1 mortal wound. Each burna bomb can only be dropped once per battle.::srs]]
- **[[Explodes]]:** 6" d3 mortal wounds
- **[[Grot Gunner]]:** +1 to hit with Twin Big Shoota [[Each time this model makes an attack with a twin big shoota, add 1 to that attack’s hit roll.::srs]]

- **[[Supersonic]]:** Pivot and move [[Each time this model makes a Normal Move, Advances or Falls Back, first pivot it on the spot up to 90 degress (this does not contribute to how far the model moves), then move the model straight fowards. It cannot pivot again after the initial pivot.::srs]]
