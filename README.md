# WAAAAAGH!!!

### What is this?

What I'm trying to do is make easily-readable, interlinked lists for Warhammer 40,000. Using an Obsidian repo nested within a Github repo, hosted with Github Pages, using Jekyll and theme elements from [here]([GitHub - Jekyll-Garden/jekyll-garden.github.io: A Digital Garden Theme for Jekyll. Jekyll Garden lets you create a static HTML version of your markdown notes and publish via Github pages. Made for Obsidian users!](https://github.com/Jekyll-Garden/jekyll-garden.github.io)) and [here]([GitHub - Maxence-L/notenote.link: A Jekyll digital garden template, optimized for integration with Obsidian. It aims to enhance discoverability and help you build a personal knowledge base that can scale with time.](https://github.com/Maxence-L/notenote.link)).
