### What is this?

What I'm trying to do is make easily-readable, interlinked lists for Warhammer 40,000. Using an Obsidian repo nested within a Github repo, hosted with Github Pages, using Jekyll and theme elements from https://github.com/Jekyll-Garden/jekyll-garden.github.io and here https://github.com/Maxence-L/notenote.link
